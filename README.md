The source code for my **website**, i've been working on it for some time now and yeah, you can peek around the code and look at all the bugs.
### About what im trying to do
I'm making a website so i can host my apps or projects or whatever on it so that it has like a _"home"_ to stay in :).
I'm not very good with CSS but i can use it and i managed to have decent results off of it so im pretty happy about this.
### What language are you the best at for web development?
I am the best at _JS_ i think because i can write in it, without having much problems, and also *HTML* because i know almost alot of things in it too :)
### More about you?
[Here](https://kenan238.github.io/#about1_group)
### Are you planning to make this repo private? Like all the others ?
No, here are a couple of reasons:
1. You have to pay for a subscription for private repo and im okay with it being public.
2. People can see the code anyways because `CTRL+SHIFT+I` or `Inspect`
### Are you planning on stopping coding?
Not at all! I have made it this far in only _2 years_ and i want to accomplish **ALOT** more!

### I still don't believe you learned that much about coding in only 2 years...
"Everything can be possible, if you work hard, chose the right path, and make the right decisions." - Definetly not me
### Sum everything up in a little sentence.
I am kenan, i've been coding for 2 years, and i'm happy.
